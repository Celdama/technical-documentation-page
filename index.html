        <h3>Basic rule syntax</h3>
        <h4>Style rule syntax</h4>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-ruby">
            style-rule ::=
              selectors-list {
                properties-list
              }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-ruby">
            selectors-list ::=
              selector[:pseudo-class] [::pseudo-element]
              [, selectors-list]

            properties-list ::=
              [property : value] [; properties-list]
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          See the index of selectors, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements below.
          The syntax for each specified value depends on the data types for
          defined for each specified property.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-ruby">
            strong {
              color: red;
            }

            div.menu-bar li:hover > ul {
              display: block;
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          For a beginner-level introduction to the syntax of selector, see our
          guide on CSS Selectors. Be aware that any syntax error in a rule
          definition invalidates the entire rule.

          <h2><span>React</span></h2>
        </header>
        <p>The smallest React example looks like this:</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-ruby">
            ReactDOM.render(

            );
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page.</p>
        <h3>How to Read This Guide</h3>
        <p>
          In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps:
          elements and components. Once you master them, you can create complex
          apps from small reusable pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React
          concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation
          sidebar. If you’re reading this from a mobile device, you can access
          the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of
          your screen. Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge
          introduced in earlier chapters. You can learn most of React by reading
          the “Main Concepts” guide chapters in the order they appear in the
          sidebar. For example, “Introducing JSX” is the next chapter after this
          one.
        </p>
        <h3>Knowledge Level Assumptions</h3>
        <p>
          React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic
          understanding of the JavaScript language. If you don’t feel very
          confident, we recommend going through a JavaScript tutorial to check
          your knowledge level and enable you to follow along this guide without
          getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as
          a result you won’t have to feel like you’re learning both React and
          JavaScript at the same time.

          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of
          the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
          technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
          appearance/presentation CSS. "Hypertext" refers to links that connect
          web pages to one another, either within a single website or between
          websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading
          content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other
          people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

          HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for
          display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such
          as <code>head</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>body</code>,
          <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code> and many others.

        <p>
          Hypertext Transfert Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol
          for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed
          for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can
          also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical
          client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a
          request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is stateless
          protocol, meaning that the serve does not keep any data (state)
          between two requests. Though often based on a TCP/IP layer, it can be
          used on any reliable transport layer, that is, a protocol that doesn't
          lose messages silently like UDP does.
        </p>
        <h3>Tutorials</h3>
        <p>Learn how to use HTTP with guides and tutorials.</p>
        <h5>Overview of HTTP</h5>
        <p>
          The basic features of the client-server protocol: what it can do and
          its intended uses.
        </p>
        <h5>HTTP Cache</h5>
        <p>
          Caching is very important for fast Web sites. This article describes
          different methods of caching and how to use HTTP Headers to control
          them.
        </p>
        <h5>HTTP Cookies</h5>
        <p>
          How cookies work is defined by RFC 6265. When serving an HTTP request,
          a server can send a Set-Cookie HTTP header with the response. The
          client then returns the cookie's value with every request to the same
          server in the form of a Cookie request header. The cookie can also be
          set to expire on a certain date, or restricted to a specific domain
          and path.
        </p>
        <h5>Evolution of HTTP</h5>
        <p>
          A brief description of the changes between the early versions of HTTP,
          to the modern HTTP/2, the emergent HTTP/3 and beyond.

          The JavaScript reference serves as a repository of facts about the
          JavaScript language. The entire language is described here in detail.
          As you write JavaScript code, you'll refer to these pages often (thus
          the title "JavaScript reference"). If you're learning JavaScript, or
          need help understanding some of its capabilities or features, check
          out the JavaScript guide. The JavaScript language is intended to be
          used within some larger environment, be it a browser, server-side
          scripts, or similar. For the most part, this reference attempts to be
          environment-agnostic and does not target a web browser environment.
        </p>
        <h3>Where to find JavaScript information</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript documentation of core language features (pure ECMAScript,
          for the most part) includes the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The JavaScript Guide</li>
          <li>The JavaScript Reference</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you are new to JavaScript, start with the guide. Once you have a
          firm grasp of the fundamentals, you can use the reference to get more
          details on individual objects and language constructs.
        </p>
        <h3>Structure of the reference</h3>
        <h5>Standard built-in objects</h5>
        <p>
          This chapter documents all the JavaScript standard built-in objects,
          along with their methods and properties.
        </p>
        <h5>Statements and declarations</h5>
        <p>
          JavaScript applications consist of statements with an appropriate
          syntax. A single statement may span multiple lines. Multiple
          statements may occur on a single line if each statement is separated
          by a semicolon. This isn't a keyword, but a group of keywords.
        </p>
        <h5>Expressions and operators</h5>
        <p>
          This chapter documents all the JavaScript language operators,
          expressions and keywords.
        </p>
        <h5>Functions</h5>
        <p>Chapter about JavaScript functions.</p>
        <h5>Classes</h5>
        <p>Chapter about JavaScript classes introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
